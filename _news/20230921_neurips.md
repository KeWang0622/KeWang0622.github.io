Our MRI off-resonance correction paper (Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for MRI Off-Resonance Correction Trained with Noise Instead of Data) was accpeted to [NeurIPS 2023](https://nips.cc/)! Project led by my awesome collaborator [Alfredo](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~asdegoyeneche/)! Arxiv and code will be available soon!
