I am a senior research engineer at Samsung Research America (SRA), MPI Lab, working on real-world computational imaging and computer vision problems. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, working with [Prof. Miki Lustig](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/) and [Prof. Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/). I was a member of [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). I also work closely with [Prof. Jon Tamir](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/) at UT Austin and [Dr. Frank Ong](https://www.frankongh.com/) at Roblox. I graduated with honor from the department of [Biomedical Engineering](http://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/)in [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html/). My research interests lie in **computational imaging, deep learning, signal processing, inverse problem, medical imaging and computer vision**. I am an enthusiast of science, engineering, music, ice skating, rock climbing and everything related to medicine and healthcare! My name in Chinese is 王可.

I did a wonderful  internship at Adobe Emerging Products Group in the summer of 2021 (Work deployed at PhotoShope Camera)!

I interned at Adobe Research as a research scientist intern from May 2022 to March 2023. I was fortunate to work with the awesome [Michaël Gharbi](http://mgharbi.com/), [He Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/hezhangsprinter), [Zhihao Xia](https://likesum.github.io/), and [Eli Shechtman](https://research.adobe.com/person/eli-shechtman/).
